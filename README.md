## Who I am

My name is Gabriele and I am 22 years old. I come from Italy but at the moment I am living in Germany. 
I am studying Medicine at the University without having any plan to become a doctor.

## A coding story

Since I was a child, I have had an inner interest for everything involving technology and science and in the more recent years I have been fascinated by the world of Computer Science.
I started to code on my own without any real purpose and get deeply involved in it. 
In the past few months I attended the CS50X classes and get a good general understanding of Computer Science.

## What I am working on

At the moment I am working on my **CS50X Final Project** and learning how to deal with Git/Github.
